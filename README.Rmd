# SynAnthrop <img src="./Figure/SynAnthrop_logo.png" align="right" alt="" width="200" />

SynAnthrop is a R package developed to assess the sensibility of species and communities to anthropisation from occurrence data.

## Workflow <img src="./Figure/Synanthrop_workflow.png" />
Principle: the analysis is based on the cross-referencing of georeferenced occurrence data and a map describing the gradient to be studied (from which values are extracted at the desired resolution). After a selection of data by species (2), a random selection of sites in the range and according to the sampling effort is made (n = observed occurrences). The effect (in this case of anthropisation) is measured by evaluating the effect size between these 2 distributions (3). The operation is repeated 500 times (4). Synanthropy scores (from 1 to 10) are assigned to each species from the average of the differences between the null and observed distributions (5).

## Dependencies
### Loading packages and function
```{r Packages, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE, results = 'hide'}
Packages <- c("tidyverse", "raster","scales","sf","ks","tabularaster", "terra", "tidyterra", "CGPfunctions")
# install.packages(Packages) # if needed

lapply(Packages, library, character.only = TRUE) # to load

source("./R/Species_Synanthropisation_Index_function.R")
# devtools::install_github("/lomorel/SynAnthrop")
```

### Data

Two types of data are required to run the Species Synanthropisation Index (SSI): (i) a database of species occurrences, with XY coordinates and corresponding sampling dates, and (ii) a raster describing the spatial gradient of anthropisation of the region to be analyse.

```{r warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
sp_by_occ_raw <- read.table("./Data/amphibian_all_2154_to_R.csv", sep=";", h=T)
head(sp_by_occ_raw)
```

```{r warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
ras_raw <- raster("./Data/CartNat_Bzh.tif")#raster
```

The map used here is the French Naturalness Map, developed by Guetté et al.(2021) https://uicn.fr/CartNat/CartNat_Donnees/Note_technique_m%C3%A9thodologique/Projet%20CARTNAT_note%20technique_2021.pdf). 

```{r warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, fig.width=10}
# create SpatRaster (can also do `x <- rast(f)`
rast_to_plot <- rast(ras_raw)

sp_map <- st_as_sf(sp_by_occ_raw, coords = c("X", "Y"), crs = 2154)
sp_map$Year <- as.integer(sp_map$Year)

ggplot() + 
  geom_spatraster(data = rast_to_plot) +
  geom_sf(data = sp_map, aes(color = Year)) +
  scale_fill_whitebox_c(palette = "muted")
```

## Running the SSI function

### Usage

The function was designed to calculate synanthropy scores automatically from a data set (for a taxon, a territory and a period). Several resolutions can be evaluated simultaneously.

### Arguments

* `- resolution`: his argument allows to test several resolutions. To do this, specify for each resolution you want to test (the value is the number of raster cells aggregated to compile species occurrences).

* `- sim`: this argument corresponds to the number of simulations to run to model the null distribution of occurrences under the assumption that the variables used for the map (raster) do not influence the species distribution.

* `- threshold`: this argument allows to fix the threshold of species occurrences under it species will be not account.

### An example with amphibian populations in western France

```{r warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, results = 'hide'}
ssi_results <- ssi(r = ras_raw, x = sp_by_occ_raw, resolution = 200 , sim = 2, threshold = 30)

```

The SSI function produce three main data.frame :

* `[[1]]` the first data.frame is a short summary table (one line per species) with the mean of all effect size and the corresponding index (range between 1 to 10) for each resolution. The number of runs used to calculate the mean effect size are also specified.

```{r warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, results = 'hide'}
head(ssi_results[[1]])
```


* `[[2]]` the second data.frame compile all the raw results, i.e all the effect size assessed per run, with corresponding information provided by the function cohen_d (rstatix package) ; n1 and n2 correspond to the number of occurrence compare (n1 for the null distribution and n2 for observed data).

```{r warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, results = 'hide'}
head(ssi_results[[2]])
```


* `[[3]]` the third data.frame archives all the occurrence randomly drawn to assess scores.

```{r warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, results = 'hide'}
head(ssi_results[[3]])
```


## Visualising SSI results

### Score distribution within the studied taxa
```{r warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
sp_ssi <- ssi_results [[1]]
sp_ssi$Index <- as.integer(sp_ssi$Index)

mean_ssi_by_resolution <-   data.frame(sp_ssi %>%
                                      group_by(Species, Resolution) %>%
                                      summarise(Index = mean(Index), n = n()))

effsize_res <- ssi_results [[2]]

# then scale by scale
sub_effsize_res <- subset(effsize_res, Resolution == "200")
mean_ssi_by_resolution <- subset(mean_ssi_by_resolution, Resolution == "200")

sub_effsize_res <- merge(sub_effsize_res, mean_ssi_by_resolution, by = "Species")
sub_effsize_res$Index <- as.factor(sub_effsize_res$Index)

ggplot(sub_effsize_res, aes(x = reorder(Species, -effsize), y = -effsize, fill = Index)) +
  geom_hline(yintercept = 0.0, color = "darkgrey", size=0.8, linetype="dashed") +
  geom_boxplot() + 
  coord_flip() +
  scale_fill_brewer(name="Score", palette = "RdYlGn") +
  ylab("Effect size") +
  theme(axis.title.y = element_blank()) +
  theme(legend.position = c(0.9, 0.2)) +
  theme_bw()

```
### Resolution comparison
```{r warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}

mean_index_by_reso <- data.frame(sp_ssi %>%
                                      group_by(Species, Resolution) %>%
                                      summarise(Index = mean(Index), n = n()))

mean_index_by_reso$Resolution <- as.factor(mean_index_by_reso$Resolution)

newggslopegraph(dataframe = mean_index_by_reso,
                Resolution,
                Index,
                Grouping = Species,
                Title = "Amphibian",
                SubTitle = NULL,
                Caption = NULL)
```
