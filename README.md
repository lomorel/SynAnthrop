## Description
`SynAnthrop` is a R package developed to assess the sensitivity of species and communities to anthropogenization based on occurrence data, via the calculation of the Species Synanthropy Index (SSI).

`Synanthrop` allows to describe the ecological affinities of species and groups in a simple, reproducible, multi-scale and less subjective way than with expert assessments. The SSI scores can then be used to identify species, communities, and related habitats that require significant conservation and restoration effort. They are complementary to other existing priorization indices such as red lists, rarity or specialization degrees.

The analysis is based on the comparison of the observed distribution of species along a gradient of anthropogenization within a territory, and a distribution that would be expected if anthropisation had no effect on this species distribution (null distribution). Null distributions are generated per species based on their range and survey intensity per site.


## Workflow

## Access the SSI analysis
Make sure that Git is installed on your computer by typing the following line of code in R Terminal (Tools > Terminal > New terminal). If Git is not installed, you will need to download and install Git on your computer.
```
git --version
```

To install Synanthrop locally with its dependencies and documentation, set the working directory to the folder where you want the project to be stored. Type the following line of code in R console:
```
remotes::install_github('https://github.com/lomorel/SynAnthrop')
```
